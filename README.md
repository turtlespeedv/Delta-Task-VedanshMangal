# Delta-Task-VedanshMangal
Hello!
this is my delta task for web development, i started from scratch from may and tried my hardest to complete the task by the deadline, i learnt html,css & js basically from zero and this website is what i was able to come up with.
i got the movements completed for all the pieces and made the website mobile responsive, just the canon shooting bullet part and rotating of the ricochets is what i was not able to do, because of that, to win the game you have to basically eat the titan of the other player by any of your piece. 
i learnt a lot during this period so thank you for that and thank you for reading this!
